Whoa. Did not know that. For real? Without fetching there's no way to diff against the remote branch? You have to have a "local version" of the remote branch? –

Because git is a distributed CVS, your local git repository will have it's local branches (master by default). But if you work with one or more remote servers, git will make a local copy of the state of these servers. They may have some of your local branches or different ones. I don't know of any way to make a diff against a remote repo directly... (at least not in git itself). –

In order to diff against a remote repo, you have to download the state of that repo. Network operations can be slow. Very slow In order to not incur the penalty of a network operation every time you run a diff, git only does the download when explicitly requested. That's what git fetch does. –
